<h1>ROAD NOT TAKEN</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>The universe has no fixed flow. Once you make any decision, it works its way around that. There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling, and action that you experience and as life is a complex formula formed up of very simple elemental decisions, which in turn creates a universe of bottomless complexity. Even a small unrelated variation in the universe that has no relations with the decision taken can end up altering the possible future events drastically. The ones who are successful didn’t follow the crowd they chose the road less traveled and forged their own path to success. Every individual has the capability to bend their path and decide the outcome of their life.
    The ability for us to make a decision is no less than a miracle, we get to choose what is the possible outcome of our own decision. This ability is what makes us unique and different from machines, the will to think.. “Don't wait for opportunity in front of a closed-door wander until you find the open one”.
    We, humans, are creative beings who cannot be imprisoned inside a cage, as we are meant to soar high without the burdens and shackles of what society gave us.
